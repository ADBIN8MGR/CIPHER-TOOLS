# 🔒 Caesar Cipher Tool
## 📘 Introduction
The Caesar Cipher Tool is a web-based application that demonstrates one of the earliest encryption techniques known as the Caesar Cipher. This tool enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext shifts by a set number of positions along the alphabet. This project provides a hands-on experience in understanding basic encryption concepts and their role in cybersecurity.

## ⚙️ Technical Description
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that encrypts each letter in the plaintext by shifting it a fixed number of positions down the alphabet, determined by the encryption key. The tool allows a shift key between 1 and 25, which the user can adjust to vary the cipher's strength. Developed in JavaScript, the tool supports both encryption (shifting letters forward) and decryption (shifting letters backward) and handles user interactions dynamically.

## 💻 Technologies Used
HTML5: 🏗️ Structures the web page layout and elements.
CSS3: 🎨 Styles the user interface and manages layout responsiveness.
JavaScript: ✨ Implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, handles real-time input/output updates, and enables user interactions.

## 🌟 Main Features
Encrypt and Decrypt 🔐: Perform Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption on user-provided text.
Adjustable Shift Key 🔄: Set the shift value between 1 and 25.
Real-Time Updates 🕒: Output updates instantly as the user types or changes input.
Clipboard Copy 📋: Copy the encrypted or decrypted text with a single click.
User-Friendly Interface 👍: Clear instructions and input validation for an intuitive experience.
